A no-nonsense goal-tracking app that helps users build habits through micro-goals.

### Complete UI Redesign with Personality & Brand

  - Neon green (secondary): `hsl(142 76% 73%)`
  - Hot pink (accent): `hsl(330 81% 60%)`
  - Yellow highlights: `hsl(48 96% 53%)`
  - Deep charcoal background with subtle gradients

- **Typography**:
  - Fredoka font for playful display headings
  - Inter font for clean body text
  - Better hierarchy with gradient text effects

- **Animation System**:
  - Custom animations: slide-up, pop, wiggle, bounce-subtle, glow, gradient
  - Smooth transitions on all interactive elements

### Dynamic Goal Generation Feature

Replaced hardcoded fallback values with a flexible system that allows users to choose between:

  - No API key required from users
  - Seamless authentication via Replit environment variables
  - Costs billed to developer's Replit credits
- **Mode Selection UI**: Simple toggle between "AI Generated" and "Manual Entry" modes
  - AI mode is the default for best user experience
  - No authentication barriers for users
- **Manual Goal Entry**: Three input fields with example placeholders
  - Inline validation shows helper text when fields are incomplete
  - Button disabled until all 3 goals are filled
- **Error Handling**: 
  - AI mode displays clear error messages for API failures
  - Users can retry without reloading the page
  - Manual mode provides immediate guidance when fields are incomplete
- **API Route**: Uses Replit AI Integrations environment variables
  - Returns descriptive errors for API failures
  - No hardcoded fallback values
  - Upgraded to gpt-5 (latest OpenAI model)
